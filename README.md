//Link to deployed GitHub Page:

Accessibility improved by:
Adding descriptive page title
Fixing broken links
Adding alt attributes to images
Adding title to background image
Divs replaced with semantic HTML elements
Footer given logical heading
Classes specific to only one element changed to ids
Duplicate 'benefit-' classes consolidated to 'benefits' class
Duplicate section content classes consolidated to 'content' class
Order of CSS script adjusted to match flow of HTML file and webpage

//Questions:
OK to use id for semantic elements which could be duplicated to futureproof? e.g. main, section, aside
OK to remove id for semantic elements which will only occur once? e.g. footer
OK to name class and id the same name?

Technologies:
